If a unit receives too much damage, the unit goes unconscious. This means that the unit starts to bleed out and needs help from other units.<br/><br/>
If someone comes to help, he can stop the bleeding to prevent the injured from bleeding out and die. After the unit is stabilized you can start the first aid process to revive the unit. After a unit is revived maybe they need a regular healing process too.<br/><br/>
If nobody comes to help the unit eventually bleeds out. The time depends on the amount of damage the unit received. Everyone can stabilize unconscious units. The ability to start the first aid process can depend on the medical education. (medic or not, medical equipment)<br/><br/>
It is possible to load/unload wounded units in vehicles to bring them out of a dangerous area or evacuate them to a field hospital.

This First Aid System (AIS = Alternative Injury System) is an alternative system to all the current normal revive scripts.<br/><br/>
The main difference to a standard revive system is that the unit does not die before going into a state of agony. If critical damage level is reached, the unit goes unconscious and does not immediately die like in most other systems. The advantage: You can use it in missions without a revive option as well!<br/><br/>
Another advantage of the system is that if a unit is gravely wounded and waiting for others to help, the wounded unit is not completely defenseless. A wounded unit can go prone, crawl and use a weapon as last stand (until the magazine is empty).
AIS also supports AI. AI soldiers can be unconscious or give first aid as well.
